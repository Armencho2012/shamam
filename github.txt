# GitHub push & PR commands

This file contains step-by-step commands you can run to push changes to GitHub and open a Pull Request. Replace values like <your-name> and <your-email> where appropriate.

1) Configure Git user (optional - only if you want to override global settings):

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

2) Create and switch to a branch for your changes (recommended):

```bash
# from project root
git checkout -b translate-arm
```

3) See status and stage files:

```bash
git status
git add -A
```

4) Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Translate UI strings to Armenian and add github.txt"
```

5) Add remote if not already present (only if you haven't added it before):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Armencho2012/shamam-s-sweet-spot.git
```

6) Push branch to GitHub and set upstream:

```bash
git push -u origin translate-arm
```

7) Open a Pull Request (recommended) via GitHub website or use GitHub CLI:

```bash
# if you have gh installed
gh auth login
gh pr create --base main --head translate-arm --title "Translate UI to Armenian" --body "Translate all user-facing text to Armenian and add github commands file"
```

8) To update the branch after more edits:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "More Armenian translations"
git push
```

9) (Dangerous) If you want to force overwrite the remote main branch with your local main (DO NOT DO THIS unless you are absolutely sure):

```bash
git checkout -b main
git add -A
git commit -m "Overwrite remote main with local"
git push -u origin main --force
```

If you want, I can run these commands for you (create branch, commit, push, and open a PR). Reply "Please push and open PR" and I'll proceed.
